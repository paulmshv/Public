Organizing an IT infrastructure for 200 users in a production environment using Linux and 4 bare metal servers requires careful planning to ensure scalability, reliability, security, and performance. Below is a step-by-step guide to help you design and implement the infrastructure:

---

### **1. Assess Requirements**
- **User Needs**: Identify the applications and services required by the 200 users (e.g., email, file sharing, databases, web apps, etc.).
- **Workloads**: Determine the types of workloads (e.g., virtual machines, containers, or bare metal services).
- **Storage**: Estimate storage requirements for user data, applications, and backups.
- **Network**: Plan network topology, IP addressing, VLANs, and security (firewalls, VPNs, etc.).
- **High Availability (HA)**: Ensure critical services are highly available.
- **Backup and Disaster Recovery**: Plan for regular backups and disaster recovery.

---

### **2. Design the Infrastructure**
#### **Server Roles**
Assign specific roles to each of the 4 bare metal servers:
1. **Virtualization Hosts**: Use 3 servers for virtualization (e.g., KVM, Proxmox, or VMware ESXi).
   - Run virtual machines (VMs) for services like web servers, databases, and application servers.
   - Use clustering for high availability (e.g., Proxmox VE cluster or Pacemaker/Corosync).
2. **Storage Server**: Dedicate 1 server for centralized storage (e.g., Ceph, GlusterFS, or NFS).
   - Provide shared storage for VMs and user data.
   - Ensure redundancy and scalability.

#### **Virtualization Platform**
- Use a hypervisor like **KVM**, **Proxmox VE**, or **oVirt** for managing VMs.
- Create resource pools for CPU, memory, and storage to allocate resources efficiently.

#### **Networking**
- Use VLANs to segment traffic (e.g., user traffic, management traffic, and storage traffic).
- Set up a firewall (e.g., `iptables`, `nftables`, or `firewalld`) to secure the network.
- Configure a VPN for remote access (e.g., OpenVPN or WireGuard).

#### **Storage**
- Use distributed storage like **Ceph** or **GlusterFS** for scalability and redundancy.
- Alternatively, set up an NFS server for simpler shared storage.

#### **Load Balancing**
- Use a load balancer (e.g., HAProxy or NGINX) to distribute traffic across web servers or applications.

### **3. Deploy Core Services**
#### **Authentication and Directory Services**
- Set up **LDAP** (e.g., OpenLDAP) or **FreeIPA** for centralized user authentication and management.
- Integrate Linux servers and applications with the directory service.

#### **File Sharing**
- Use **Samba** for file sharing with Windows clients or **NFS** for Linux clients.
- Ensure proper permissions and quotas for user data.

#### **Email**
- Deploy an email server (e.g., Postfix + Dovecot) or use a cloud-based solution like Gmail or Outlook.

#### **Web Applications**
- Host web apps (e.g., Nextcloud for file sharing, Mattermost for team chat) on VMs or containers.
- Use Docker or Podman for containerized applications.

#### **Database**
- Deploy a database server (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MariaDB) for applications.
- Use replication for high availability.

#### **Monitoring and Logging**
- Set up monitoring tools like **Prometheus + Grafana** or **Zabbix**.
- Use centralized logging with **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or **Graylog**.

### **4. Implement Security**
- **Firewall**: Configure firewalls on all servers and network devices.
- **SSH**: Disable root login and use SSH keys for authentication.
- **Updates**: Regularly update all servers and applications.
- **Backups**: Implement automated backups (e.g., using `rsync`, Bacula, or Restic).
- **Intrusion Detection**: Use tools like **Fail2Ban** or **OSSEC** for intrusion detection.

---

### **5. High Availability and Scalability**
- Use clustering for critical services (e.g., database, web servers).
- Implement load balancing for web applications.
- Plan for horizontal scaling by adding more servers or migrating to the cloud if needed.

---

### **6. Backup and Disaster Recovery**
- Schedule regular backups for VMs, databases, and user data.
- Store backups offsite or in the cloud (e.g., AWS S3, Backblaze).
- Test disaster recovery procedures regularly.

---

### **7. Documentation and Training**
- Document the infrastructure setup, including network diagrams, IP addresses, and configurations.
- Train IT staff on managing and troubleshooting the infrastructure.

---

### **8. Tools and Technologies**
- **Virtualization**: KVM, Proxmox VE, oVirt.
- **Storage**: Ceph, GlusterFS, NFS.
- **Networking**: OpenVPN, WireGuard, HAProxy, NGINX.
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, Zabbix.
- **Backup**: Bacula, Restic, rsync.
- **Security**: Fail2Ban, OSSEC, iptables.

---

### **Example Architecture**
1. **Server 1-3**: Virtualization hosts running VMs for web servers, databases, and applications.
2. **Server 4**: Storage server with Ceph or GlusterFS for shared storage.
3. **Network**: VLANs for user traffic, management, and storage; firewall for security.
4. **Services**: LDAP for authentication, Samba/NFS for file sharing, HAProxy for load balancing.

By following this approach, you can build a robust, scalable, and secure IT infrastructure for 200 users in a production environment.
